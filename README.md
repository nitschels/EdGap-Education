# EdGap-Education
EdGap data analysis project for DATA 3320

In this project, we will explore the disparities in education based on multiple columns using machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.

Source of data:
https://github.com/galenegan/DATA-3320/tree/main

To get the training and test data, the data was first split into a test and training split, the test data being 20% of the data. It was then normalized and imputed upon to get rid of NaN values.
